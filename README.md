To analyse large-scale e-commerce data sets (Big Data) using Apache Spark i.e. PySpark.

### Objective:

In this case study, you will work on e-commerce customer behaviour analysis using Apache Spark, a powerful distributed computing framework designed for big data processing. This assignment aims to give you hands-on experience in analysing large-scale e-commerce data sets using PySpark. You will apply techniques learnt in data analytics to clean, transform and explore customer behaviour data, drawing meaningful insights to support business decision-making. Apart from understanding how big data tools can optimise performance on a single machine and across clusters, you will develop a structured approach to analysing customer segmentation, purchase patterns and behavioural trends.

### Business Value :
 
E-commerce businesses operate in a highly competitive market where understanding customer behaviour is critical to driving growth and retention. To stay ahead, companies must leverage data-driven insights to optimise marketing strategies, personalise customer experiences and improve product offerings.
